✅ Completed Work
1. LiveNotification Fix (Task 1)
Moved notification overlay from top-4 right-4 to bottom-4 right-4 to prevent overlap with page content
2. Comprehensive Reminder Auto-Generation System (Tasks 3-4) ✨
Architect Approved - The system is production-ready with:

Schema Enhancements:

Added new reminder types: mortgage, insurance, property_tax, hoa, permit
Added compliance tracking fields to properties: insuranceExpiryDate, insuranceCarrier, propertyTaxDueMonth, propertyTaxDueDay, hoaFeeAmount, hoaFeeDueDay
Added entity tracking fields: licenseRenewalDate, permitExpiryDate
Auto-Generation Features:

Mortgage payments: Monthly reminders (5 days before due on 1st)
Insurance renewals: Multi-stage reminders (90, 60, 30 days before expiry)
Property taxes: Multi-stage reminders (60, 30, 7 days before due)
HOA fees: Monthly reminders (5 days before due)
License/Permit renewals: Multi-stage reminders (90, 60, 30 days before expiry)
Technical Implementation:

Idempotent deduplication by (orgId, property/entity, type, title, leadDays)
Unique titles for multi-stage reminders: "Insurance Renewal Due (90 days) - PropertyName"
Daily cron job runs at 8 AM
Proper type categorization for filtering and analytics
3. Admin Calendar Page (Tasks 5, 10-11)
Created and Accessible:

New page at /admin-calendar with route and navigation
Based on contractor calendar structure with week/day/month views
Fetches reminders and maintenance cases
Timezone-aware initialization
Cache invalidation working across all pages
4. Cache Synchronization (Task 10)
All reminder mutations properly invalidate /api/reminders query key
Admin calendar, contractor calendar, and reminder pages stay synced
⚠️ Remaining Work
Admin Calendar Refinements (Tasks 6-9)
The admin calendar page exists but still needs adaptation from its contractor schedule template:

Task 6: Implement drag-and-drop for reminders and maintenance cases
Task 7: Add status-based color coding:

Reminders: overdue (red), due-soon (orange), upcoming (blue), completed (green)
Maintenance cases: by status
Task 8: Build multi-filter system:

Reminder type filter (mortgage, insurance, tax, etc.)
Maintenance status filter
Property filter
Entity filter
Task 9: Add legend and filter toggles:

Show color meanings
Toggle between All/Reminders Only/Maintenance Only
Task 12: End-to-end testing
