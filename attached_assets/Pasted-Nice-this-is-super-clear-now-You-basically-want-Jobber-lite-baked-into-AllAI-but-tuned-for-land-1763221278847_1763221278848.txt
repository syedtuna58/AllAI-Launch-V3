Nice, this is super clear now. You basically want “Jobber-lite” baked into AllAI, but tuned for landlords + contractors.

Below is a developer-ready blueprint you can hand to whoever is building this in Replit.

1. End-to-end flow we’re copying (adapted for AllAI)

From your screenshots, the full lifecycle is:

Create client + property

Create quote (line items, discounts, tax, deposit)

Send quote (SMS / email / link)

Client approves + pays deposit

Convert quote → job

Schedule job on calendar

Do the work + internal notes

Mark job complete → generate invoice

Invoice applies deposit and any extras

Collect final payment + send receipt

We’ll mirror that exactly, but with AllAI’s AI router feeding in clients/issues.

2. Core data model (tables) you need

Think in terms of 7 main tables plus a couple helpers.

2.1 Client

Represents owner or tenant.

id

type ('owner' | 'tenant' | 'manager')

first_name

last_name

company_name (optional)

phone

email

receives_text (boolean)

lead_source

notes

created_at, updated_at

2.2 Property

id

client_id (owner)

label (e.g. “Unit 3B”, “Wheeling Clinic”)

street_1

street_2

city

state

zip

country

billing_same_as_property (bool)

billing_address_json (if different)

extra_details_json (has gas, has boiler, etc.)

created_at, updated_at

2.3 Contractor

id

business_name

contact_name

email

phone

contractor_types (array: ["plumber","hvac"])

service_areas (ZIPs or geo)

rating (float)

active (bool)

notes

created_at, updated_at

2.4 Quote

id

client_id

property_id

contractor_id

title (e.g. “Stump Grinding & Tree Removal”)

status

'draft' | 'sent' | 'awaiting_response' | 'approved' | 'declined' | 'converted_to_job'

subtotal

discount_amount

tax_amount

total

deposit_type ('none' | 'percent' | 'fixed')

deposit_value (e.g. 50 or 500)

required_deposit_amount (computed)

deposit_paid_amount (sum of payments linked to this quote)

expires_at

client_message (email body)

contract_disclaimer

internal_notes (only internal)

sent_via ('sms' | 'email' | 'link' | null)

sent_at

created_at, updated_at

2.5 QuoteLineItem

id

quote_id

name (e.g. “Tree Removal”)

description

quantity

unit_price

total

is_optional (bool)

is_taxable (bool)

service_date (optional, copied to job)

image_url (optional)

Later you can reuse this schema for Invoice line items.

2.6 Job

id

quote_id (nullable if created directly)

client_id

property_id

contractor_id

title

status
'draft' | 'scheduled' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'requires_invoicing' | 'closed'

required_deposit_amount (copy from quote)

deposit_paid_amount (copy/payments)

outstanding_deposit_amount (computed)

instructions (from quote description)

start_datetime

end_datetime

schedule_later (bool)

team_assigned_json (array of workers)

internal_notes (like Jobber’s “Internal notes”)

created_at, updated_at

In UI, show Total price / Required deposit / Outstanding deposit like in your screenshot.

2.7 Invoice

id

job_id

quote_id

client_id

property_id

contractor_id

subject (e.g. “Stump Grinding & Tree Removal”)

status
'draft' | 'sent' | 'partial_paid' | 'paid' | 'void'

issue_date

payment_due ('upon_receipt' | 'net_7' | 'net_30' | etc.)

subtotal

discount_amount

tax_amount

total

deposits_applied_amount (from payments tied as deposit)

balance_due (= total - deposits_applied_amount - normal_payments)

client_message

internal_notes

created_at, updated_at

2.8 InvoiceLineItem

id

invoice_id

name

description

quantity

unit_price

total

is_taxable

service_date (optional)

Usually auto-created from QuoteLineItem, with ability to add extra lines for change orders (“Additional stump” in your screenshot).

2.9 Payment

id

client_id

invoice_id (nullable if deposit only)

quote_id (nullable, for pre-job deposits)

job_id (optional helper reference)

amount

type ('deposit' | 'final' | 'partial' | 'refund')

method ('ach' | 'credit_card' | 'cash' | 'check' | 'cash_app' | 'paypal' | 'venmo' | 'zelle' | 'other')

transaction_date

reference_number

details

status ('recorded' | 'void')

created_at, updated_at

That lets you:

Track required vs outstanding deposit on Quote + Job.

Apply “Add Deposit” on invoice, like Jobber does.

Show invoice balance at the bottom.

3. Status transitions (the important logic)

Use simple rules so devs don’t improvise:

3.1 Quote status

draft → sent (when SMS/email/link sent)

sent → awaiting_response (when you choose “Mark as awaiting response”)

awaiting_response → approved (client clicks Approve)

awaiting_response → declined (client rejects)

approved → converted_to_job (when you “Convert to Job”)

If a deposit is required:

When client approves but hasn’t paid yet:

keep approved, but deposit_paid_amount < required_deposit_amount

job may be created but flagged as “Deposit outstanding”.

3.2 Job status

draft → scheduled (start/end date set)

scheduled → in_progress (contractor checks in)

in_progress → completed (work done checkbox)

completed → requires_invoicing (auto)

requires_invoicing → closed (after invoice paid)

3.3 Invoice status

draft → sent (email/SMS)

sent → partial_paid (payment < total)

sent → paid (payments cover total − deposits)

partial_paid → paid

Any → void

When an invoice is paid, close the job if not already closed.

4. Screen-by-screen UX for AllAI
4.1 Dashboard (“Home”)

Borrow from Jobber:

To-do tiles:

“Create quote”

“Get paid with fast invoicing”

“Set up client portal”

Business performance:

Receivables ($ outstanding)

Upcoming jobs

Revenue this month

You can keep this simple for now—just counts and sums.

4.2 New Client / Property Screen

Mirror the “New Client” screen:

Left panel: Client details

Title, first/last name

Company name

Checkbox “Use company name as primary”

Main phone + “Receives text messages” toggle

Main email

Lead source

(Expandable) automated notifications / extra client details

Right panel: Property details

Street 1/2, city, state, zip, country

Checkbox “Billing address is the same as property address”

Additional property details (unit, access notes, gate code)

When you save, redirect to Client detail screen.

4.3 Client Detail Screen

Exactly like your screenshot:

Header: name, lead badge.

Left / center:

Properties list

Tabs: Active Work | Requests | Quotes | Jobs | Invoices

Right:

Contact info

Tags

Last communication

Billing history / current balance

CTA buttons:

“New Quote”

“New Job”

“New Invoice” (for one-off things)

4.4 New Quote Screen

Layout similar to what you captured:

Top:

Property address

Contact details

Main grid:

Product / Service (text area with description)

Qty, Unit Price, Total

Add photo

Buttons:

“Add Line Item”

“Add Optional Line Item”

“Add Text”

Right column:

Subtotal

Discount (link: “Add Discount”)

Tax (link: “Add Tax”)

Total

“Required Deposit” → “Add Required Deposit”

Input: value

Dropdown: % or $

Below line items:

Client message (email/SMS)

Contract / Disclaimer (terms)

Internal notes + file upload (link to Job and Invoice checkboxes like Jobber)

Save area:

“Save Quote”

“Save and…” dropdown:

Send as Text Message

Send as Email

Mark as awaiting response

Convert to Job (only if approved)

4.5 Deposit Logic in UI

When you Add Required Deposit:

If 50 % of $2,000 → compute $1,000 and store in required_deposit_amount.

Show:

“Required deposit: $1,000”

After any payments:

“Deposit paid: $X”

“Outstanding deposit: $1,000 − X”

On the Job screen (like your screenshot) show:

Total price

Required deposit

Outstanding deposit

(read-only summary pulled from quote/payments).

4.6 Job Creation & Internal Notes

When converting quote → job:

Copy:

client, property, contractor

title

line items

deposit data

Job screen:

Job title & instructions

Line items panel

Internal notes box + file upload

Checkbox “Link notes to invoices”

Schedule:

Start date/time

End date/time

“Schedule later”

Button: Save Job, Save and…

4.7 Calendar View

Like your calendar screenshot:

Month view

Each scheduled job shows as block

Clicking an event opens detail card:

Completed checkbox

Job title

Details (from quote)

Team

Location

Starts / Ends

Buttons: “Edit”, “View Details”

When “Completed” is checked:

Set job status → completed and requires_invoicing.

Show banner in Job screen: Requires invoicing with Generate Invoice button.

4.8 Generate Invoice From Job

From the job screen:

Button Generate Invoice:

Create Invoice with line items copied from quote.

Pre-fill subject, billing address, property, contact details.

Set status draft.

Invoice edit screen includes:

Subject

Billing address / property address / contact

Issue date (default: today)

Payment due (“Upon receipt” etc.)

Invoice follow-ups box (later you can automate reminders)

Line items list:

Copy from quote

You can add new line items (e.g. “Additional Stump”)

Right side: Subtotal, Discount, Tax, Total

Deposits: “Add Deposit” link (adds deposit applied to invoice)

Bottom:

Internal notes

Buttons:

“Save Invoice”

“Save and…” (Send Email / Send Text / Mark as Sent)

4.9 Collect Payment

From Invoice view:

Button: Collect Payment

Other, ACH bank payment, Cash, Check,

Credit/debit card, Cash App, PayPal, Venmo, Zelle

Amount (defaults to outstanding balance)

Note: “Payment applied to Invoice #X”

Buttons:

Save

Save and Email Receipt

Back-end action:

POST /payments
  - if invoice_id set:
      update invoice.balance_due
      update invoice.status (partial_paid / paid)
  - if quote_id & type='deposit':
      update quote.deposit_paid_amount
      update job.deposit_paid_amount

5. API endpoints (for a Replit backend)

Whatever language you choose (FastAPI / Flask / Express), you’ll want at least:

POST /clients, GET /clients/:id

POST /properties, GET /properties/:id

POST /contractors

POST /quotes, GET /quotes/:id

POST /quotes/:id/send (marks sent + triggers SMS/email)

POST /quotes/:id/approve (client action)

POST /quotes/:id/convert-to-job

POST /jobs, GET /jobs/:id

POST /jobs/:id/complete (sets requires_invoicing)

POST /jobs/:id/generate-invoice

POST /invoices, GET /invoices/:id

POST /invoices/:id/send

POST /payments (handles both deposit + invoice payments)
