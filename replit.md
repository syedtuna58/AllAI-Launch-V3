# AllAI Property Management Platform

## Overview
AllAI Property is a comprehensive property management platform designed for part-time landlords and small property management companies. It enables users to track properties, manage tenants, monitor maintenance issues, handle expenses, and stay organized with automated reminders. The platform aims to provide an intuitive interface for managing real estate portfolios, including features like ownership entity management, smart case tracking, and automated regulatory compliance.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript, using Vite for building.
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing, including protected routes.
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives, styled with Tailwind CSS (light/dark mode support).
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management and caching.
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod for type-safe validation.

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js.
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules.
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations.
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth (OpenID Connect) via Passport.js.
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store.
- **Background Jobs**: Node-cron for scheduled tasks.
- **API Design**: RESTful API with consistent error handling.

### Database Design
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon serverless driver.
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle migrations.
- **Key Entities**: Users, Organizations, Properties, Tenants, Leases, Units, Smart Cases, Financial transactions, and Automated reminders.
- **Relationships**: Complex many-to-many relationships, especially for properties and ownership entities.

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Provider**: Replit Auth using OpenID Connect.
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions.
- **Protection**: Middleware-based authentication on client and server.
- **User Management**: Automatic user creation and organization assignment.

### Development & Deployment
- **Build System**: Vite for frontend, esbuild for backend production builds.
- **Type Safety**: Shared TypeScript types across frontend and backend.

## Integration Notes

### Twilio Integration (✅ CONFIGURED)
- **Status**: Active via Replit Connector
- **Purpose**: SMS verification codes for contractor/tenant signup, emergency notifications
- **Implementation**: `server/services/twilioClient.ts` using Replit's connector API
- **Usage**: Automatic phone verification in multi-user authentication flows

### SendGrid Integration (❌ NOT CONFIGURED)
- **Status**: User dismissed integration setup
- **Alternative**: Email service (`server/services/emailService.ts`) uses graceful fallback - logs email content without sending
- **Future**: Can be configured later via Replit SendGrid connector or manual API key
- **Note**: Magic link authentication and tenant invites will log emails to console until configured

## Recent Changes (November 2025)

### Multi-User Authentication System Transformation
The platform has been transformed from a single-user toggle-based role system to a full multi-user authentication platform supporting four distinct user types with separate logins and role-based access control.

**User Types:**
1. **Platform Super Admin** (owners) - Full system access, view all orgs
2. **Org Admin** (landlords) - Property management, tenant invites, contractor favorites
3. **Contractor** - Job marketplace access with specialty-based filtering
4. **Tenant** - Unit view, case submission, appointment approval

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Email/SMS verification flows with magic links and verification codes
- Session management with indefinite refresh tokens (localStorage-based)
- RBAC middleware with data scoping utilities
- Contractor marketplace with 60 specialties across 6 tiers
- 4-hour timeout notifications for hands-off landlords on non-urgent cases
- Cron jobs for timeout checks (30 min) and session cleanup (daily 4 AM)

**Security Considerations:**
- Refresh tokens stored in localStorage (high-severity XSS risk - acceptable for MVP, should migrate to httpOnly cookies + short-lived access tokens before production)
- Data scoping prevents contractors from accessing portfolio data
- Role-based query filters ensure data isolation

**Completed Features:**
- ✅ Platform Admin dashboard (`/admin`) - View all orgs, users, system stats
- ✅ Landlord (Org Admin) dashboard (`/landlord`) - Properties, tenants, cases, favorites
- ✅ Contractor dashboard (`/contractor`) - Marketplace, assigned jobs, proposals
- ✅ Tenant dashboard (`/tenant`) - Unit view, case submission, appointment approval
- ✅ Tenant auto-invite flow - Landlord invites tenant → email verification → auto-account creation
- ✅ Maya AI role-scoped data access - Contractors see job-only, no portfolio data
- ✅ Security fixes: Token replay prevention, contractor assignment validation

**Security Validations Completed:**
- Tenant verification tokens bound to email/tenantId (prevents replay attacks)
- Contractor Maya scoping validates assignment before returning job context
- RBAC middleware validates orgRole membership to prevent cross-org leakage
- Data scoping utilities prevent contractors from accessing portfolio/financial data

**Pending Work:**
- Contractor team management (optional)
- Remove legacy RoleContext toggle system
- Comprehensive systematic testing of all user flows
